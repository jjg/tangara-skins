Not a lot here so far, submissions/pull requests welcome!

## Usage

Copy the `.lua` file for the desired theme onto your SD card in a directory named `.themes` as described in [the docs](https://cooltech.zone/tangara/docs/themes/).

Copy the directory for the them to `.themes`.

> Note: Don't use the `example` theme here, it's bad.

Copies of the original theme files from [git.sr.ht/~jacqueline/tangara-fw](https://git.sr.ht/~jacqueline/tangara-fw) can be found in the [stock-themes](./stock-themes) directory for inspiration (or if you really shoot yourself in the foot).

This could be a lot slicker, and maybe eventually will, but not right now.
